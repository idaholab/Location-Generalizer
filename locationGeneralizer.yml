documentation: 
  odbcConnectionString: >
    This value must be tailored to the user's database environment. 
    https://www.connectionstrings.com/ is a useful site for finding a valid connection string.
    The example shows a typical SQL Server, DSN-less connections style, as well as an ODBC
    connection when using a CSV file as input. The CSV file example depends on the creation of
    a DSN. Performance will probably suffer if a CSV file is used.

  inputTableOrCSV: The name of the database table or CSV file to use for input

  vehiclesInChunk: >
    This is the number of vehicles to process per pass. Memory is spared by not processing all 
    vehicles at once. Testing has shown that 100 or 200 provides efficient perfomrmance, but
    this can be changed to suit the system

  qryVehicleIDList: >
    This query finds all the vehicle IDs that will be processed

  qryVehicleInfo: >
    This is the main vehicle data query and will read in a "chunk" of vehicles to process.
    vehiclesInChunk specifies the chunk size. This query reads a chunk for processing and
    continues reading chunks until all data has been processed

      Note: A trip's starting and ending coordinates are validated to see if they are within one of the bounding boxes.

  gpsOdoThreshold_mi: >
    This value allows for a little slop in GPS coordinates. Odometer mileage should never be less
    the calculated GPS mileage, but this allows for a small amount of GPS coordinate inaccuracy.
    Given in miles.

  minTrips: Minimum number of trips to process vehicle's data
  minLastTrips: Number of day's last trip required for determining home location in Module1

  Validation: 
    DoValidityChecking(vData): >
      Calls the methods below against vData which is the vehicle data
      The validation methods are applied to each row of vData and the Include column is tagged with True or False
      indicating whether the row is valid to use in clustering/home detection algorithm.

    InBoundingBox(vd, colLat, colLon): >
      Checks that latitude or longitude is in one of the bounding boxes that roughly describe USA (including AK and HI)

      Checks that value in the datetime column given in colname can be parsed as a datetime value
  
    CompareOdometerToGPS(vd, tripStart, tripEnd, stLat, stLng, enLat, enLng, threshold): >
      Checks that vehicle odometers distance (tripEnd - tripStart) is not less that the calculated
      distance between the start and end GPS coordinates. (disallow worm holes :-)
  
    Server side validation assist: >
      Some validation occurs on the database server side -
      The vehicleID and trip start time are required to be order. See order by in qryVehicleInfo sql statement.
      Python is case-sensitive and the column names returned from the sql query must match the column names used
      in the code, i.e., the sql queries provided have column names that match the python scripts case-sensitive
      requirements. Altering the case of any column names will cause the code to fail.

  Important internal data structures:
    divisions (geopandas array): >
      These US Census Divisions are used instead of assigning a state to the home location.
      This gives a location sense but even more obscure that a state of th US. The divisions
      were obtained as a shapefile from the US Census website. The shapefile was compressed into
      a Pickle file. The "pickled" data is then simply read into the divisions object.

    EVSEs: A list of charging stations thorughout the US
    
    firstVehicleInChunk (pandas DataFrame): > 
      A list of vehicle IDs, but just the first one of each chunk (see vehiclesInChunk)
      of data. This list controls the amount of data to query at a time, by controlling the number of vehicles to query at one time.
    
    chunkData (pandas DataFrame): > 
      A chunk of vehicle data. Chunks of data will have vehicle data for only a certain number of
      vehicles at one time, defined by vehiclesInChunk. (The last chunk may have less vehicles)
    
    chunkDataIDs (numpy ndarray): > 
      A list of all the vehicles IDs in the current chunk.
    
    vData (pandas DataFrame): > 
      The vehicle data for the vehicle currently being processed. Simply a subset of chunkData. 
      Bad records aree removed after data validation.

      VehicleID: 
        The ID of the vehicle
      TripStartLocalTime:

      TripStartOdometer_Miles: 
        The odometer reading (in miles) at trip start

        True/False flag indicating whether data in this row passed validation checks
  
    coordsSet (numpy ndarray): > 
      A list of all unique GPS coordinates (start and end latitude and longitude values) from vData

    clusterLbls (numpy ndarray): >
      A list of cluster IDs. The values have one-to-one correspondence with the coordsSet array.
      They group the coordsSet records into clumps as detgermined by the clustering alorithm.

    findHome_Module1: This module attempts to find home by evaluating the cluster with the most GPS points.
    getEVSEDistance: Helper function that returns the havesine distance between home and EVSE location
    getStartLocationDistance: Helper function that returns the havesine distance between home and trip start location.
    getStartLocationDistance: Helper function that returns the havesine distance between home and trip end location.
    processHome: Creates the HomeInfo and LocationInfo data after home has been determined
    flagTrips: Identifies the first and last trip of the day for a vehicle
    InBoundingBox: Validation helper - determines if location is within one of the US states bounding boxes
    CheckDateTime: Validation helper - determines if value is a valid datetime

  Output files:
    heartbeat.txt: >
      After each vehicle is processed, the vehicle ID is written to this file.

      where it left off using the vehicle ID here.

    errorLog.csv: >
      Tracks any non-fatal errors that occur. Ususally just validity check infomation.

    HomeInfo.csv: >
      This file and LocationInfo.csv are the two main output files. This file shows the
      home location(s) that were determined for each vehicle. The details are available
      in other documentation.

    LocationInfo.csv: >
      This shows the info for each each trip, including distances from home. See details
      in other documentation.
